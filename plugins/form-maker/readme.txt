The Form Maker is one of the best responsive form builders in WordPress Plugin Directory. WordPress Form Builder allows you to set all the parameters such as colors, fonts and dimensions to best fit all form standards. If you want to make minimalistic forms, you can build forms with pre-filled texts, avoiding long form field labels.

Form Maker is a fresh and innovative form builder for generating various kinds of forms. The back end of the Form Maker is essential and easy to use, with no need of advanced programming skills.

The Form Maker uses a number of customizable themes.  You can choose the design of the form to fit your website/webpage. Moreover, the Form Maker theme CSS is open for editing and making necessary changes, for creating a custom form design. To choose the best fitting form design, you can first preview the created forms changing the form theme and pressing preview button. 

WordPress Form Maker can be used both for simple and multipart forms. That is why this form builder is a perfect choice for the beginners, who are just starting with forms and also meets the needs of experts (with advanced themes and multiple form customization possibilities).

The commercial version of the Form Maker has Google Map integration for the geolocation as well as pre-filled address demonstration in the forms. The details of the longitude and latitude can be provided in the back end of the form. 

To make the process of creating forms easier, the package includes a list of pre-installed forms for different purposes. There is a possibility of saving those forms as copies and editing them to fit your needs.

PayPal integration of the Form Maker (commercial version) allows you to add PayPal features into the form, thus making it possible to use the Form Maker as a great tool for creating donation forms, whereas Survey Tools form field allows creating manageable questionnaire forms.  

This form builder has a Captcha field to protect from receiving spam with the forms. The form field comes with two options: a simple Captcha and ReCaptcha (the famous Captcha by Google).

CSV/XML export possibility allows using the submitted data for data analysis and data presentation creating charts, diagrams and other visual forms.

To make larger forms fit and look great on your pages and posts, you can use pagination option, cutting the form into multiple pages.
