= What is MailChimp? =

MailChimp for WordPress is a plugin that connects your WordPress site to MailChimp, so you will need to have a MailChimp account first. MailChimp is a newsletter service that allows you to send out email campaigns to a list of email subscribers. MailChimp is absolutely free for lists up to 2000 subscribers, which is why it is the go-to choice for small businesses or starting entrepreneurs. That doesn't mean MailChimp is not a great choice for bigger businesses though.

If you do not yet have a MailChimp account, [creating one is 100% free and only takes you about 30 seconds](https://mc4wp.com/out/mailchimp).

== Installation ==

= Installing the plugin =
1. In your WordPress admin panel, go to *Plugins > New Plugin*, search for **MailChimp for WordPress** and click "*Install now*"
1. Alternatively, download the plugin and upload the contents of `mailchimp-for-wp.zip` to your plugins directory, which usually is `/wp-content/plugins/`.
1. Activate the plugin
1. Set [your MailChimp API key](https://admin.mailchimp.com/account/api) in the plugin settings.

= Configuring Sign-Up Form(s) =
1. Go to *MailChimp for WP > Forms*
2. Select at least one MailChimp list to subscribe people to.
3. *(Optional)* Add more fields to your form using the **add MailChimp field** dropdown.
4. Embed a sign-up form in pages or posts by using the `[mc4wp_form]` shortcode.
5. Show a sign-up form in your widget areas using the "MailChimp Sign-Up Form" widget.

`
<?php

if( function_exists( 'mc4wp_form' ) ) {
	mc4wp_form();
}
`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= More documentation =
More detailed documentation can be found in the [MailChimp for WordPress knowledge base](https://mc4wp.com/kb/#utm_source=wp-plugin-repo&utm_medium=mailchimp-for-wp&utm_campaign=faq).

= How to display a form in posts or pages? =
Use the `[mc4wp_form]` shortcode.

= How to display a form in widget areas like the sidebar or footer? =
Go to **Appearance > Widgets** and use the **MailChimp for WP Form** widget that comes with the plugin.

= How to display a form in my template files? =
Use the `mc4wp_form()` function.

`
if( function_exists( 'mc4wp_form' ) ) {
	mc4wp_form();
}
`

= Where can I find my MailChimp API key? =
[You can find your MailChimp API key here](http://kb.mailchimp.com/accounts/management/about-api-keys#Find-or-Generate-Your-API-Key)

= How to add a sign-up checkbox to my Contact Form 7 form? =
Use the following shortcode in your CF7 form to display a MailChimp sign-up checkbox.

`
[mc4wp_checkbox "Subscribe to our newsletter?"]
`

= The form shows a success message but subscribers are not added to my list(s)? =
If the form shows a success message, there is no doubt that the sign-up request succeeded. MailChimp could have a slight delay sending the confirmation email though, please just be patient and make sure to check your SPAM folder.

When you have double opt-in disabled, new subscribers will be seen as *imports* by MailChimp. They will not show up in your daily digest emails or statistics. [We always recommend leaving double opt-in enabled](http://blog.mailchimp.com/double-opt-in-vs-single-opt-in-stats/).

= How can I style the sign-up form? =
You can use custom CSS to style the sign-up form if you do not like the themes that come with the plugin. The following selectors can be used to target the various form elements.

`
.mc4wp-form { ... } /* the form element */
.mc4wp-form p { ... } /* form paragraphs */
.mc4wp-form label { ... } /* labels */
.mc4wp-form input { ... } /* input fields */
.mc4wp-form input[type="checkbox"] { ... } /* checkboxes */
.mc4wp-form input[type="submit"] { ... } /* submit button */
.mc4wp-alert { ... } /* success & error messages */
.mc4wp-success { ... } /* success message */
.mc4wp-error { ... } /* error messages */
`

You can add your custom CSS to your theme stylesheet or (easier) by using a plugin like [Simple Custom CSS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-custom-css/#utm_source=wp-plugin-repo&utm_medium=mailchimp-for-wp&utm_campaign=after-css-link)

= I'm getting an "HTTP Error" when trying to connect to MailChimp =

If you're getting an `HTTP Error` when trying to connect to your MailChimp account, please contact your webhost and ask them if they have PHP CURL installed and updated to the latest version (7.40.x).
Also, please ask them to allow requests to `https://api.mailchimp.com/`.

= My question is not listed =

Please head over to the [MailChimp for WordPress knowledge base](https://mc4wp.com/kb/#utm_source=wp-plugin-repo&utm_medium=mailchimp-for-wp&utm_campaign=faq) for more detailed documentation.
